    <p>Dearest Chesca,</p>
    <p>I know things aren't alright between the two of us, but I've been meaning to make something special for you for the past few days.</p>
    <p>This whole project, every icon, every line of code, and every bug I've encountered, was done with you in mind. It's my way of saying that even in the tiniest details, I think of you.</p>
    <p>You've brought a kind of warmth into my life that I didn't even realize I was missing. I still remember how all of this started, from the simple moments to something that means the world to me now.</p>
    <p>Everytime I hear you laugh, everytime I see you smile, I feel lucky. Very lucky. Like REALLY really really really lucky.</p>
    <p>Even though things get rough sometimes, and we have times when we don't see each other eye to eye, I want you to know that I will always be here. I will always choose you. You're worth every late night, every ups and downs, and every ounce of effort just to make you smile.</p>
    <p>You're the kind of person I want to be better for, and every moment with you feels like something I wanna hold on to forever. Just wanted to remind you how much you matter.</p>
    <p>You’re the reason why I’m willing to try, again and again, no matter how hard.</p>
    <p>Whenever you're ready, I’m here, always.</p>
    <p>Yours, Markus</p>
